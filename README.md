ðŸš§ Work in progress, alpha coming soon.

## What is Vue Grid Layout?

vue-grid-layout is a grid layout system, like [Gridster](http://dsmorse.github.io/gridster.js/), for Vue.js. **Heavily inspired by [React-Grid-Layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout)**

## Features

* Draggable widgets
* Resizable widgets
* Static widgets
* Bounds checking for dragging and resizing
* Widgets may be added or removed without rebuilding grid
* Layout can be serialized and restored
* Automatic RTL support (resizing not working with RTL on 2.2.0)
* Responsive
